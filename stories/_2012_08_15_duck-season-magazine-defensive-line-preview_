Defensive Line — Dion Jordan, Taylor Hart, Wade Keliikipi, Arik Armstead
The defensive front line will certainly miss departed seniors Terrell Turner and Brandon Hanna, but the “next-man-up” attitude on the offensive line also carries over here. If last season was any indication, defensive end Dion Jordan (first team All-Pac-12, 42 tackles, 7.5 sacks) might be ready for a monster senior season.
Taylor Hart started all 14 games at defensive tackle last season, and his motor is unstoppable. Expect him to be as consistent as ever.
Elsewhere, many will likely wonder how involved true freshman Arik Armstead will be. At this point, it’s impossible to say how much the heralded recruit from Elk Grove, Calif., will play, but a noteworthy fall camp would bring him a long way toward increased time on the field. At a monstrous 6-foot-8 and 297 pounds, he’s certainly mature enough physically to contribute right away. Whether his schematic development can catch up enough to his physical stature remains to be seen.
