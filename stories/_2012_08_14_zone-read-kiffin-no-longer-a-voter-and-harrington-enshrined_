Editor’s note: This week’s “Zone Read” posts are being done by incoming reporter Hayden Kim. 
It would be foolish not to begin the day with the controversy at USC, as Head Coach Lane Kiffin decided to give up his vote in the Coaches Poll this season.
After telling reporters that he did not vote his current USC football team number one, news fled that Coach Kiffin did indeed vote his team number one. After the incident, Coach Kiffin relinquished his vote in the Coaches Poll, saying: “”It is an opportunity and responsibility that I do not take lightly. However, I find it necessary to relinquish my voting status.”

In-house, Will Rubin post on Monday’s practice and freshman running back Byron Marshall.
Finally, National Recruiting Analyst Craig Haubert talks about how the Ducks are making noise in ESPN’s Recruiting Nation’s 2013 Recruiting Class Rankings with a small number of committed players.
Tweet of the day:
That’s the thing with freshmen: Gotta give ‘em a chance to prove it on the field. Coaches know it’s unfair to inflate expectations just yet.
