The Ducks returned to the practice field on Tuesday for their second day of fall camp and their last before they don shoulder pads for the first time this summer. Head coach Chip Kelly said the team is working on installing plays today, and will continue with that approach for the rest of the week before focusing on more situational practice.
Kelly said the Ducks will add a handful of plays each day, mostly for the benefit of newcomers.
“It’s not stuff that they haven’t heard before,” Kelly said. “Unless you’re a young kid, and that’s the thing — the freshmen have never been through any of this so it’s all brand new terminology to them.”
Despite the fact that it was just the team’s second official practice since the Spring Game, Kelly said the Ducks have hit the ground running this week, something he says is a testament to the team’s conditioning.
“We don’t ease into it, we’re full go right when we blow the whistle the first time,” Kelly said.
Tight end Colt Lyerla, expected to be the Ducks starter on September 1st missed practice for the second consecutive day. Kelly said at the Ducks media day that Lyerla would return “soon” but offered no specific timetable or explanation for his absence.
