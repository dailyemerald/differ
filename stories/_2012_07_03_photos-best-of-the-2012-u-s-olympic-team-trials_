The Trials are over and Track Town is quiet for the summer, but what an exciting two weeks it was. Current and former Ducks shined bright with Ashton Eaton putting on a spectacle in the decathlon — setting a new world record — and Galen Rupp proving his dominance at distance, breaking Oregon legend Steve Prefontaine’s meet record in the 5,000-meter run. The heavy downpours did not stop the Hayward crowd from coming out in full force to fill the grandstands day after day cheering on these impressive athletes. The light now shines on London but for now, here are 32 selects from the 2012 Olympic Trials.
