Adam Jude of The Oregonian reports Tuesday night that George Horton — head coach of the University of Oregon baseball team since it’s rebirth in 2009 — is still without a new contract, and negotiations with the university are at a standstill with the expiration of his current deal less than a month away.
Horton’s initial contract is set to expire on Sept. 10 and was for a base salary of $450,000 a year. The new contract requested for Horton by his agent would be for $600,000, which would make him one of the highest paid baseball coaches in the country.
Baseball is not considered a “revenue sport” in collegiate athletics, and Oregon’s Athletic Department reported baseball to have an operating deficit in excess of 1.5 million dollars in 2011.
