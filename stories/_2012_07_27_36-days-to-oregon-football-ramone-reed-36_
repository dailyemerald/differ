Editor’s note: In the final 50 days before Chip Kelly and the Ducks return to the field to defend their status as Pac-12 Champions, the Emerald sports desk will take a look back at one Oregon alum each day whose jersey number corresponds to the amount of days left before the season opener against Arkansas State.
Though he never reached star status in Eugene, Ramone Reed bounced around the depth chart as a linebacker for the Ducks from 2001 to 2004, appearing in a handful of games each season and making plays on special teams as well. Reed made an impact right away, leading the special teams unit in tackles as a freshman in 2001, but a late-season wrist injury slowed his development. He would continue to play a limited role defensively, seeing more and more time as a linebacker each year.
Reed added two interceptions in his senior season, including a red-zone pick against Washington. The 31-6 win at Autzen Stadium started the Ducks current winning streak against the Huskies, which now stands at eight games. With Oregon leading 17-6 early in the fourth quarter and Washington inside the Oregon five-yard line, Reed picked off Casey Paus — one of four Duck interceptions and seven Husky turnovers on the day — to keep the Huskies out of the endzone.
Reed still lives in the Eugene area where he is now the defensive coordinator at South Eugene High School.
