Friday afternoon, Curtis Anderson of the Register-Guard reported that associate athletic director Vin Lananna will no longer lead the Oregon track and field program. While the timing of the move is unknown, Lananna will remain with Oregon in a different role.
His eventual replacement will be assistant head coach Robert Johnson, who was named the NCAA’s 2011 women’s indoor coach of year. To reiterate, it is not known exactly when he will step in for Lananna, or when Lananna will shift roles.
According to Anderson, neither Lananna nor Johnson returned calls requesting comment. We will get you more information as details emerge in the coming hours.
