While Galen Rupp took the silver in the men’s 10,000-meter run, other Ducks have been taking their turns shooting for glory in London as well.
On Friday, Andrew Wheating and Matthew Centrowitz made it through the prelims of the men’s 1,500-meter race. Wheating seemed to struggle, crossing the line in 3:40.92 in the last qualifying place. Centrowitz took fifth in his heat, moving on with a time of 3:41.39.
In Sunday’s semifinal, Wheating was only able to run a 3:44:88 and did not qualify for the final. Centrowitz however, finished in 3:34:90 — taking fifth — and qualified last in his heat for Tuesday’s final, which is expected to take place at 1:15 p.m., PST.
Recent Oregon graduate Brianne Theisen, competing for Canada in the heptathlon, finished 11th with 6,383 points. She achieved four personal bests in London, including a time of 2:09:27 in the 800-meter run — the third best in the group. Her other personal bests were in the long jump at 6.01 meters, shot put at 12.89 meters and javelin throw at 46.47 meters.
Also, another former Duck, Becky Holliday ,qualified for the pole vault finals with a vault of 4.55 meters. The final will be Monday at 11 a.m., PST.
