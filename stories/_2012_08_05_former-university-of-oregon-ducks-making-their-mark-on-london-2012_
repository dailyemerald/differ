While Galen Rupp took the silver in the men’s 10,000-meter run, other Ducks have been taking their turns at medals in London as well.
On Friday, Andrew Wheating and Matthew Centrowitz made it through the prelims of the men’s 1,500-meter race. Wheating seemed to struggle, making it in 3:40.92 and only in the last qualifying place. Centrowitz took fifth in his heat, with a time of 3:41.39.
And in Sunday’s semi-final, Wheating was only able to run a 3:44:88 and did not qualify for the final. Centrowitz however, finished in 3:34:90 — taking fifth — and qualified last in his heat for Tuesday’s final. The final is expected to take place at 1:15 p.m., PST.
Canadian and just-graduated University of Oregon Duck Brianne Theisen competed in the heptathlon, finishing 11th with 6,383 points. She achieved four personal bests in London, including a time of 2:09:27 in the 800-meter run — the third best time of the group. Her other personal bests were in the long jump at 6.01 meters, shot put at 12.89 meters and javelin throw at 46.47 meters.
Becky Holliday qualified for the pole vault finals, with a vault of 4.55 meters. The final will be Monday at 11 a.m., PST.
