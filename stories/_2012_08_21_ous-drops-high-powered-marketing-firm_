In an email sent directly to Oregon University System’s Chancellor George Persteiner and members of the OUS board, University of Oregon Vice President for Student Affairs Robin Holmes announced that the UO will not be following the advice of RBI Strategies and Research.
The firm, which was hired to help the EMU Task Force garner student approval for the EMU renovation plans, planned a campaign budget of $20,000-$30,000.
“We have terminated the contract with the marketing firm. Students and others were correct and appropriate in raising this as a concern,” Holmes wrote in her email.
She plans to address further student concerns about the $135 million project.
