The 2000 Oregon team served in many ways as a precursor of things to come in 2001 and beyond for the program. One foreshadowed element was the prowess of quarterback Joey Harrington – nicknamed “Captain Comeback” for his ability to bring the Ducks from behind in the fourth quarter – emerging in a crucial Pac-10 contest on the road against Arizona State.
Down 49-35 with under six minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Ducks did their best to erase the deficit but looked to have come up short as the Sun Devils needed one first down to run out the final 30 seconds. Running back Mike Williams fumbled the ball and Harrington found tight end Justin Peelle one play later to send the game to overtime.
After both teams failed to score in the first overtime, Oregon put a touchdown on the board with a one yard Allan Amundson run. With the pressure on, ASU responded quickly with a pass from quarterback Jeff Krohn and were an extra point from triple overtime. Instead, the Sun Devils faked the kick and failed to connect with tight end Todd Heap in the back of the end zone. The Ducks escaped the desert with a 56-55 victory and the tale of Captain Comeback was born.
