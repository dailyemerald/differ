Linebackers — Boseko Lokombo, Kiko Alonso, Michael Clay
This may be Oregon’s most solidified position on offense or defense. Josh Kaddu and Dewitt Stuckey’s departures will hurt to a certain extent, but both Kiko Alonso and Boseko Lokombo proved last season they’re more than capable of contributing on a full-time starter level (79 tackles, 4.5 sacks and four interceptions combined in 2011).
Michael Clay will be the unquestioned leader of the linebacking corps and likely the entire defensive unit — few know Oregon’s defensive schemes better than the senior from San Jose, Calif. The backups — Derrick Malone, Anthony Wallace, Tyson Coleman — are far from proven, and this might be the only Achilles’ heel of the unit. Should any of the starters go down — and Clay struggled with injuries throughout 2011 — it’s unclear whether Oregon has the depth to press forward as it has in past seasons. Judging purely by the starters, though, it’s hard to find fault with the linebackers who will see the bulk of playing time on opening weekend.
