Three separate rapes occurring over the past five days have been reported to the Eugene Police Department by an anonymous source.
“No female victims have come forward or wish to file a report, so the information is unverified,” said EPD spokeswoman Melinda McLaughlin in an email. Although EPD did speak with one victim, she asked for anonymity and did not wish to file a report. Similar reports came in from second and third hand sources.
One source told EPD that the alleged rapes, starting June 28, were all committed by similar suspects; a six-foot tall black male, weighing roughly 200 pounds with a muscular build. The man was also reported to have a shaved head and was wielding a knife during the alleged rape. One was reported to have happened to a woman walking alone on June 29 around 10 p.m. on a bike path near Autzen Stadium.
EPD encourages everyone to practice personal safety by walking in groups or pairs in lighted areas, keeping strangers out of your personal space, keeping to yourself and not talking to people you don’t know, and if you feel at all in danger to call 9-1-1. They also say, if grabbed, to make as much noise and fight back as much as possible.
If anyone has any information on the alleged attacks, you can report any relevant information to EPD at (541) 682-5111.
