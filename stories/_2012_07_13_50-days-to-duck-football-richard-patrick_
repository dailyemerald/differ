In the final 50 days before Chip Kelly and the Ducks return to the field to defend their Rose Bowl crown, the Emerald  sports desk takes a look back at one Oregon alum each day who’s jersey number corresponds to the number of days left before the season opener against Arkansas State.  Today’s featured former Duck is Dick Patrick, a hard-nosed two-way player from the colloquially named “leatherhead” days of football.
A linebacker and center from 1949-1951, Patrick represents the quite pedestrian past of Oregon football.  Patrick was drafted by San Francisco in 1952, but never had a significant professional career. Perhaps somewhat representative of a tumultuous era of Duck–then Webfoot-football, the teams Patrick played on never beat Oregon State or Washington. Patrick played for coach Jim Aiken in his first two seasons before iconic Oregon head coach Len Cassanova took over in 1951.
The Oregon football that Patrick played for was a far cry from today’s budding powerhouse–there was no Moshofsky Center, no Cassanova Center and Autzen Stadium was still over a decade away from its groundbreaking.  Patrick’s teams played some home games at Hayward Field, with higher profile games contested at Multnomah Stadium in Portland (which would eventually become Jeld-Wen Field after half a century of renovations and name changes).
