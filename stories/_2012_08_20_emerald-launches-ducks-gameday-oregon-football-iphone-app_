The Emerald Media Group, the student news nonprofit at the University of Oregon, today released its first Oregon football app for the iPhone.
Ducks GameDay, sponsored by The Duck Store, is an amazing new way for fans to stay connected with their team with features not found on any other Oregon football app on the market:

NEWS: A stream of breaking news, features, photos and videos from the Emerald’s award-winning student journalists
FEED: A social media wire that features Twitter and Instagram posts from fans, players and reporters
STATS: Oregon stats, roster and schedule
DEALS: Exclusive deals on Ducks gear from The Duck Store

The app, now available for free in the App Store, is the first major project produced by the Emerald since its transition from a traditional daily newspaper to a modern college media company.
Ivar Vong, mobile and web developer, led the project development team, and Gaston Figueroa, a senior journalism major from Argentina, managed all aspects of the design. Other students who helped design the app and produce its content include:

Andy Rossback, editor in chief, a junior journalism major from Coos Bay
Matt Walks, sports editor, a senior journalism major from Billings, Mont.
Alex McDougall, photo and social media editor, a senior from Portland
Isaac Rosenthal, digital sports editor, a senior journalism major from Los Angeles
Will Rubin, digital sports editor, a sophomore journalism major from Eugene
