I was disappointed by the “Eugene has state’s highest gas prices” article (ODE 7/30/12). In the paper edition, the deck reads: “Locals struggle to find alternatives as public transit remains unreliable.” There is only one quote from one student to back up the statement that “public transit remains unreliable.”

I have found the buses and the EmX to be pretty reliable and a much better bus system than other cities where I have lived.

However, I encourage the Emerald staff to back up statements like this with statistics or studies to give a more complete picture (There is at least one related study available on the LTD site). And, there is no mention of bike riding as an alternative.  Biking is a great and especially cheap way to get around at only pennies per mile versus the government reimbursement rate of $0.555 per mile for a car.
