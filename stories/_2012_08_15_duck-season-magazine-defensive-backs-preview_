Defensive backs — Ifo Ekpre-Olomu, Troy Hill, Terrance Mitchell, Dior Mathis, John Boyett, Erick Dargan
With Cliff Harris conspicuously absent from last year’s defensive backfield, three true freshmen — Ekpre-Olomu, Hill and Mitchell – were thrown into significant roles. Surprisingly, the Ducks didn’t miss a beat, largely thanks to the veteran leadership from Boyett and rover Eddie Pleasant, who graduated last spring.
Ekpre-Olomu possesses the most potential of the sophomore trio. He played in every game last season — racking up 34 tackles along with eight pass breakups — and displayed elite coverage skills. The former four-star recruit could have a breakout campaign in 2012-13.
Mitchell is another big-time talent who should start opposite Ekpre-Olomu. He had two picks and 10 pass breakups in 2011 as well as showed solid cover skills and a nose for the ball as a first-year player. He should see more challenging assignments in a larger role as a sophomore.
Boyett can be counted on to display the leadership, obsessive attention to detail and fearlessness that’s made him one of the conference’s best safeties during his career as a four-year starter.
Dargan is a ball hawk but has big shoes to fill in replacing Pleasant. He’s shown progression this spring and should be an interesting storyline as the Ducks look for reliable play behind Boyett.
