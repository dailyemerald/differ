Kelly said he wondered why nobody recruited Eaton for the gridiron, and said he could have gone both ways (offense and defense) for the Ducks.
The majority of today’s session with Kelly was spent trying to figure out who won the team’s three-point shooting contest during this summers’ competition between different groups of players. Kelly, Dion Jordan, B.J. Kelley and Devon Blackmon were all unable to answer – Kelley appeared ready to do up-downs for not knowing until Kelly waved him off.
