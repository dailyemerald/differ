Oregon’s all-time leader in touchdown passes, Danny O’Neil quarterback the 1994 team that won the Pacific-10 Conference crown and played in Oregon’s first Rose Bowl Game since 1958. Though the Ducks lost to Penn State, O’Neil had one of the greatest outings by a quarterback in the history of the Rose Bowl. In The 38-20 loss he set Rose Bowl records for completions and passing yards, among others. He would be inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2003.
At the time, O’Neil’s Rose Bowl performance was the second best outing ever by an Oregon quarterback.
O’Neil threw for over 8,000 yards in his Oregon career and ranks second in school history in passing yards, but the Orange County native was never drafted into the NFL. O’Neil had a very brief Arena Football League career before returning to Eugene where he is now a pastor.
