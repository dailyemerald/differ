Editor’s note: This week’s “Zone Read” posts are being done by incoming reporter Hayden Kim. 
Summer is inching towards its conclusion and that can only mean one thing: Oregon football is right around the corner. We start out the day with Duck Season Magazine, published by the Emerald as an all-encompassing guide to the upcoming season. From Marcus Mariota to Colt Lyerla, there’s no excuse for being unprepared for another exciting season. For a hard copy, go to your neighborhood Duck Store starting Monday.
Continuing on the topic of Duck football, Rob Moseley shows footage of Coach Kelly’s initial thoughts about the first preseason scrimmage alongside his own analysis – without having seen a play, of course. Also from Moseley, a look at what channels we should expect to see the Ducks and other Pac-12 teams on this season – both locally and nationally – as the Pac-12 Network prepares for launch this evening.
Pac-12 Network channel update: Looks like the regional network on Comcast in Eugene is 420 standard, 720 HD, and national is 421 standard.

From SB Nation, Bud Elliot discusses Pac-12 betting lines – you know, if sports betting was legal – for win totals and why the Ducks are predicted to win at least 10.5 games this season.
Lastly, ESPN’s Jared Shanker takes a look “Into the Lions’ Den” as he talks about the recent sanctions on Penn State’s football program and how that has impacted not only current recruits, but future recruits as well.
