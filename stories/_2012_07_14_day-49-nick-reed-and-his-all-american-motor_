Arriving in Eugene, Mission Viejo lineman Nick Reed was known for playing at a high level despite only being 6’2″ and 228 pounds – extremely small for a collegiate defensive end. Four years and 20 pounds later, Reed exited Oregon as an All-American, fan favorite and as a role model for future defensive lineman to learn from.
After spending the 2005 season as a back up, he took advantage of a rash of injuries to entrench himself in the starting lineup for the majority of the 2006 season; a spot he wouldn’t relinquish for the duration of his Oregon career. Reed was an integral part of the defensive-line rotation during his first two years as a Duck, but bigger things were on the horizon.
In 2007, Reed was a breakout player for Oregon as the team rode the dynamic tandem of  Dennis Dixon and Jonathan Stewart to a #2 ranking before, well, this happened. Reed had a season to remember, earning second-team All-American honors as well as a spot on the first-team all Pac-10 list. While he led the team with 60 tackles and had a streak of 10 straight games in which he recorded a tackle-for-loss. Reed was a star off the field as well, making an appearance on  ESPN’s Academic All-America list.
For an encore in 2008, Reed earned first-team All-American honors from the Walter Camp foundation as he led the Pac-10 in both sacks with 10 on his way to winning the Morris Trophy, awarded each year to the Pac-12′s top defensive lineman. The small lineman with the endless engine led the country with five fumble recoveries and was fourth in the country with 13 sacks. Reed ended his senior season with a bang, recording 3 TFL and 3 sacks against rival Oregon State as the Ducks kept the Beavers from the Rose Bowl in a 65-38 drubbing. 
After his senior season, Reed was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the 2009 draft and made an immediate impact, returning a fumble 79 yards for a touchdown during his rookie season. Reed has since bounced around the NFL and most recently signed a 2-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings prior to the 2012 season.
