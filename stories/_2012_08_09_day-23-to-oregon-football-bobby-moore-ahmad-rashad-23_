Bobby Moore came to Eugene from Tacoma, Washington as a wide receiver, but move to running back following his sophomore season in 1969.  What ensued was the growth of one of the best running backs ever to play at Oregon.
In his two years at running back, Moore amassed 2333 rushing yards to go along with over 1500 receiving yards, a mark that still ranks in the top 10 of the Ducks’ all-purpose yards list.
Moore’s senior season earned him All-American honors as he rushed for over 1200 yards, including a 249-yard performance against Utah that was an Oregon single-game record at the time.  He was selected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007.
After Oregon, Moore moved on to the NFL where he had a successful career as a wide receiver, raking in almost 500 receptions and four pro-bowl seasons. He also holds the NFL record for the longest play from scrimmage (98 yards) that didn’t result in points.
Additionally, Moore converted to a variation of Islam – United Submitters International – in 1972 and changed his name to Ahmad Rashad.
Rashad moved on to television after the end of his football career, working on various sports broadcasts with NBC and ABC, including a long stint on “NBA Access with Ahmad Rashad” with ABC.
