		A run-off will determine the third and final ticket to London for the U.S. in the women’s 100-meter dash.
More than a week ago, Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh finished in a literal dead heat, crossing the finish line within thousands of a second of each other. Previously, it had been determined that the split would be decided by either a coin flip or a run-off.
On Sunday, USATF announced that Felix and Tarmoh would take the track to settle the dispute. The tiebreaker race will be aired tomorrow on NBC live at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
More to come as details emerge.
