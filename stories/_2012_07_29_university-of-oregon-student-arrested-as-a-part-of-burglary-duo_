After two burglaries were reported at the Skybox apartments, the Eugene Police Department, University of Oregon’s Department of Public Safety and UO students came together to aid in the arrest of 20-year-old digital arts major Heather Hamilton. Hamilton and a 17-year-old male relative from Washington were charged with first-degree burglary and conspiracy.
For both burglaries, police say the pair went through the property’s main door and into unlocked apartments, taking cash and other valuable items while at least one of the residents was asleep.
Originally, witnesses were able to describe the suspects, but there was no definitive identification. However, students took to Facebook to discuss the burglaries, and EPD was able to to use the information to help narrow the suspects’ list. The follow-up led to the arrest of the duo on Saturday, July 28.
