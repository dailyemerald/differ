As most fervent fans know, Oregon isn’t renowned for producing outstanding quarterbacks on a consistent basis through its entire history. That being said, the program has laid claim to a respectable list of distinguished signal callers over the years. Here are some of the all-time greats to have suited up in the green and yellow.

Van Brocklin is a member of the Pro and College Football Halls of Fame and was named an All-American in 1948. He led the Pacific Coast Conference in passing two times and in punting once. He also spearheaded Oregon’s journey to its first bowl game in 29 years, the 1949 Cotton Bowl, and finished sixth in voting for the Heisman trophy that season.

Fouts is a member of the Oregon Sports and Pro Football Halls of Fame and left Eugene holding 19 school records. He is sixth all-time in career passing yards, despite having played just three seasons.
