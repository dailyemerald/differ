Ducks quarterback Marcus Mariota was characteristically quiet following Thursday’s practice, but he did indicate that Thursday’s scrimmage between offenses would be a huge “evaluation” between him and fellow starting quarterback candidate Bryan Bennett.
Mariota was also informed of his candidacy for Kirk Herbstreit’s “Ahead of the Curve” Herbie Award — a recognition he won just a few hours later. The 6-foot-4 dual-threat quarterback from Honolulu acknowledged the appreciation but quickly steered talks back toward steady daily improvement.
