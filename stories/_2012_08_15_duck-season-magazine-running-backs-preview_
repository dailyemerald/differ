Running back — Kenjon Barner, Byron Marshall, Ayele Forde
There is no question that the loss of three-time all-conference running back LaMichael James will be felt in more ways than one when the 2012 season begins. Fortunately, the Ducks have a proven talent in senior Kenjon Barner, who played a crucial role in each of the last three seasons as James’ backup. Barner’s touches figure to double as the featured back, though it’s easy to forget the 5-foot-11, 195-pound senior carried the ball 152 times a year ago and will likely surpass the 2,000-yard mark for his career within the first two weeks of the season.
Things do get a little murky behind the senior. True freshman Byron Marshall will likely be pressed into action his first year on campus — without the added benefit of the spring season to get a grasp on Chip Kelly’s challenging playbook. What has been a deep position for Oregon in recent years will be a bit of a question mark entering summer camp.
