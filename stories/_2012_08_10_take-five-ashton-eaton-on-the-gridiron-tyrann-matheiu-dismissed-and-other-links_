We’ll start today with the big college football news out of Baton Rouge today that star LSU defensive back Tyrann Mathieu (AKA Honey Badger) has been dismissed from the team and will likely seek to play at a lower-level school before moving on to the NFL. His prospects for next year could prove problematic however, depending on what exactly transpired at LSU.
“If Tyrann Mathieu became ineligible bc of a 3rd failed drug test, he will not be able to play this yr at another NCAA school.”

On the subject of Oregon football, Rob Moseley notes that the Ducks have brought all 64 recruits signed under Chip Kelly to Eugene since 2010. That’s really impressive considering the current landscape of the sport.
Also from Moseley, a look at key Oregon contributors who are now healthy after battling injuries last year.
SB Nation blog Addicted to Quack takes a look at the running backs on Oregon’s roster.
From earlier this week, CBS Sports’ Chris Huston goes over what De’Anthony Thomas has to do in order to contend for the Heisman Trophy in 2012.
Tweet of the day:
“Even if Mathieu were eligible/interested/able to come here, that would be monumentally stupid from a PR standpoint. Not that Chip cares …?”
