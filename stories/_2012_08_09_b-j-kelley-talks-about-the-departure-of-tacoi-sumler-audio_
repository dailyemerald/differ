“I was surprised, he was a really good friend of mine,” Kelley said. “He said it’s just something he wanted to do. He definitely could have done whatever he wanted to do (at Oregon).”
Kelley was also asked about Ashton Eaton, saying that if he wanted to, he could have a track career as well. On Eaton, Kelley said that he would put him at running back, saying he “could do some damage.”
