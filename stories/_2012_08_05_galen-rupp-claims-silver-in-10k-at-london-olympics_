After breaking Steve Prefontaine’s Olympic Trials record in Eugene this June, former Duck Galen Rupp exceeded expectations in London, claiming silver in the men’s 10,000 meters with a time of 27 minutes, 30.90 seconds. Rupp is the first athlete from a non-African nation to medal in the event since 1988, and the first American to medal since 1964.
During Rupp’s collegiate career at Oregon, he became the first person ever to win six NCAA distance races during the same academic year when he captured the 2008 NCAA Cross Country crown, the 2009 NCAA Indoor 3,000-meter, 5,000-meter and distance-medley titles as well as the 2009 NCAA Outdoor 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Rupp’s training partner, Mo Farah of England, delivered on high expectations by winning the gold in 27 minutes, 30.42 seconds. He is the first man to ever win the 10,000 on his home soil.
