DPS Sgts. Scott Clark and Scott Geeting graduated Friday from the state police academy in Salem. They had the same 16-week training program that graduated former Chief and Executive Director Doug Tripp.
Both officers are now certified, but will continue with field training and classroom training throughout their careers. They join a handful of other officers that have become certified over the course of the summer, as a part of the much larger police force transition.
