Former Oregon great Joey Harrington will be joining FOX Sports as a college football analyst for the networkâ€™s college football pregame show, according to USA Today and The Oregonian.
The former Duck standout, who accumulated a 25-3 record during his collegiate career, will appear alongside former ESPN reporter Erin Andrews and Ohio State legend Eddie George. Harrington last appeared in an NFL game in 2008 with the Atlanta Falcons.
FOX is expected to corroborate the reports with an official announcement later Wednesday.
