Bob Berry played quarterback for three years under legendary Ducks head coach Len Cassanova, leading the Ducks to three straight winning seasons and a 1963 Sun Bowl win over Southern Methodist. After his career in Eugene Berry would go on to play over a decade in the NFL for the Vikings and Falcons, though it was neither of those teams that drafted him out of Oregon.
The three straight winning seasons Berry led the Ducks to were the first time Oregon had accomplished that feat in 30 years.
Berry played before the AFL/NFL merger and was selected in both league’s drafts in 1964, by the AFL’s Denver Broncos and the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles, but he signed with Minnesota as a free agent in 1965. Berry would remain with the Vikings until 1968 when he moved to the Falcons. Between 1968 and 1972 he would start 51 games and eventually find his way onto a Pro Bowl roster in 1969.
His career in the NFL ended where it started when Berry returned to Minnesota to back up Fran Tankerton until he officially retired in July of 1977. Berry was inducted into the University’s Hall of Fame in 1992.
