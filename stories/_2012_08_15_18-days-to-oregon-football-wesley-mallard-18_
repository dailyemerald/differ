The appropriately named Wesley Mallard led the Ducks in solo tackles in his senior season. Throughout his time in Eugene, Mallard made his share of big hits, and had a knack for big plays in general, stepping in front of passes and scooping up loose balls. Mallard’s performances earned him a second-team all-conference selection his senior season before he was drafted in the sixth round by the Giants in 2002.
Mallard’s ascent to the pros was an unlikely one. The Columbus, GA, native came to Eugene from Hardaway High School in Columbus, but his prep career also included a stint playing at the Seoul American school in Seoul, South Korea. The linebacker was a four year letterman at Oregon but started life as a walk-on before working his way up the depth chart and eventually into the next level where he played on five different teams between 2002 and 2008.
