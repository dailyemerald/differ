One of the top wideouts in Duck history, Keenan Howry was among Joey Harrington’s go-to receivers, racking up 2698 yards on 173 career catches. Howry’s 24 touchdown catches are tied for first all time in school history.  Howry played three seasons for the Minnesota Vikings and was away from football for two years before signing with the Canadian Football League’s Hamilton Tiger Cats in 2007.
Howry set a single game school record for all purpose yards against Stanford in 2001, adding 186 return yards to his 152 receiving yards on the afternoon, but his record would be shortlived as teammate Onterrio Smith bettered his mark by four yards a week later against Washington State. Throughout his career Howry continued to put up big punt return numbers, and Howry’s 1221 career punt return yards still stands atop the Oregon record book. Howry would set another Oregon record that season, reeling in four touchdown passes against Arizona State.
