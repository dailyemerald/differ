A statement released by USATF Monday afternoon announced that Jeneba Tarmoh has withdrawn herself from a tie-breaking run-off in the women’s 100-meter dash.
With the withdrawal, Tarmoh acknowledges her removal from consideration for the U.S. Olympic Team, instead becoming an alternate. Tarmoh could still potentially land on the 4×100-meter relay team, should she be asked.
Allyson Felix — who previously won the women’s 200 meters — will now also represent the U.S. in the women’s 100-meter dash in London.
