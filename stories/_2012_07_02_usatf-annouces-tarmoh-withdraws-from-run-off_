A statement released by USATF announced that Jeneba Tarmoh has withdrawn herself from the tie-breaker run off.
Tarmoh acknowledges her removal from the U.S. Olympic Team, instead becoming an alternate. This also means she could potentially land on the 4×100 team, should she be asked.
Allyson Felix will now be the third representative in the women’s 100 meter dash for the U.S. in London.
