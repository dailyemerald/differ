After holding off the Oregon State Beavers to advance to their first Rose Bowl in 15 years, the Oregon Ducks faced off against the storied Ohio State Buckeyes in Pasedena, California. The Ducks would not prevail on the BCS stage this time around, in large part due to the exploits of Buckeyes quarterback Terrelle Pryor.
Pryor – who had Oregon among his finalists while a top recruit in high school – lit up the California sky with 266 yards passing and two touchdowns, though his biggest impact was felt on key plays late in the game when the Oregon defense was on the ropes. Pryor’s 26 yard completion to tight end Jake Ballard with under nine minutes to go served as a crippling blow, and the subsequent touchdown pass put the Ducks on the ropes.
Another storyline from this game was the relative ineffectiveness of Oregon’s offense compared to most of the regular season – especially the running game. Running back LaMichael James only ran for 70 yards and quarterback Jeremiah Masoli threw for just 81; much lower than their season averages.
Additionally, LeGarrette Blount was the victim of a fluke play as a fumble on the Ohio State 18 yard line squirted all the way through the back of the end zone – resulting in possession for Ohio State. When it was all said and done, the Buckeyes left Pasedena with a 26-17 victory, while Oregon left with motivation for the 2010 season.
