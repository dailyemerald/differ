As you watch the clock melt away the work week, Rob Moseley takes a look at why Autzen’s 82 game sellout streak could also be in jeopardy on September 1. There are about 5,000 tickets left for the contest against Arkansas State and Autzen’s official capacity is 54,000, so there’s work to be done if the streak is to hold.
From the Oregonian, Adam Jude goes over some of the Duck’s new helmets and jerseys for this upcoming season. Various outlets had pictures of the gear on twitter as pictured below and the full uniform reveal is expected on August 22nd.
