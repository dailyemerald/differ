Today was also a competition day for the Ducks, something Kelly said wouldn’t normally occur the day after a scrimmage, but the coaches wanted to see how the players would respond. The offense defeated the defense by a sizable margin in said competition and will have the honor of wearing yellow jerseys on the practice field until the next competition practice.
Listen to the full audio above to hear Kelly’s take on Bryan Bennett and Marcus Mariota, as well as freshmen Bralon Addison and Byron Marshall.
