Wide receiver — Josh Huff, Daryle Hawkins, De’Anthony Thomas
For the second year in a row, Oregon’s wide receiving corps remain somewhat of a mystery. Lavasier Tuinei far surpassed expectations for his senior season, and the Ducks will need someone to step up in the same fashion in 2012. With only three seniors on the roster — Justin Hoffman, Will Murphy and Rahsaan Vaughn — and a trio of redshirt freshmen expecting to become impact players in the fall, this figures to be a position of key interest during summer camp.
Junior Josh Huff and sophomore Eric Dungy have proven to be talented options on the outside, while sophomore Keanon Lowe and junior Daryle Hawkins have climbed their way up the depth chart as blue-collar workers. Of course, sophomore sensation De’Anthony Thomas will be in the mix as a slot receiver again, and few players have speed remotely comparable to the Los Angeles native. He will be used in a variety of ways as a sophomore and should have an even better understanding of the playbook once the season begins.
