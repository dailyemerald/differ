The year was 1994 and it was an era of Washington domination in the border war, with the Huskies having won 17 of the previous 20 contests. With Washington driving it looked for all the world like that streak was going to continue. Jerry Allen will tell you what happened next:
“Huard, he’s gonna go back to throw the ball, steps up, looks, throws towards the corner of the endzone it is intercepted! Intercepted the Ducks have the ball!  Down to the 35, the 40, Kenny Wheaton’s gonna score! Kenny Wheaton’s gonna score! Twenty, the ten, touchdown! Kenny Wheaton, on the interception, the most improbable finish to a football game.”
With that one play, Kenny Wheaton cemented himself in Oregon football lore, and set into motion a role reversal in the Oregon/Washington rivalry. The Ducks would go on to play in the Rose Bowl that year, their first appearance in the “Granddaddy of Them All” since 1958. Though the Ducks would eventually lose to Penn State, Wheaton’s pick remains one of the most iconic moments in Duck football history.
After his career at Oregon, Wheaton would go on to have a brief professional career in the NFL, Arena league and the CFL. Wheaton now focuses on raising money for his foundation, the Kenny Wheaton Foundation, which works with kids to develop strong character and have a positive impact on the community.
