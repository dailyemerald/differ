Monday afternoon, Appalachian State announced that wide receiver Tacoi Sumler, who redshirted for Oregon last season, is officially transferring to the program. Sumler, a 5-foot-9, 173-pound wideout, begins practice with the Mountaineers this week.
A four-star recruit from Christopher Columbus H.S. in Miami, Fla., Sumler announced intentions to transfer closer to home earlier this month. He is eligible to play at Appalachian immediately and has four years of eligibility remaining.
