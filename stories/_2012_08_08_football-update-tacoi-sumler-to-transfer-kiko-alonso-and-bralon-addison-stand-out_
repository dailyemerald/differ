The big news out of Oregon’s camp today was the subtraction of redshirt freshman Tacoi Sumler from the roster. Sumler was one of many young receivers looking to earn playing time, and head coach Chip Kelly said the young speedster wanted to be closer to his Miami home for his remaining eligibility.
“He wants to get a little closer to home and he wants to drop down a division,” Kelly said.
Regarding players still on the roster, Kelly had high praise for offensive lineman Kyle Long — son of NFL Hall-of-Fame defensive lineman Howie Long — and the quick transition he’s made from junior college to the division-one level.
“For (Long) to be where he is right now, I’m actually not surprised,” Kelly said. “I’m pleased. We’ll see how he progresses.”
Additionally, offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich praised freshman wide receiver Bralon Addison when asked about his progress, noting that quarterbacks Bryan Bennett and Marcus Mariota had singled him out for quality play during summer workouts.
