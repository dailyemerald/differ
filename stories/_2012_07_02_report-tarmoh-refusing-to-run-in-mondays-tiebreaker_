Sports Illustrated reported Sunday night that Jeneba Tarmoh was refusing to run in Monday’s run off. Early reports said that she not only believed she had won, but believed that there are pictures to prove it.
Monday morning, Wesley Felix – Allyson Felix’s manager – told ESPN that she would be at Hayward today, unless a cancellation was officially announced by USATF.
This controversy comes after the women’s 100-meter dash ended in a dead heat between Tarmoh and Felix. After a few days of discussion, a run-off was decided as the best course of action.
Should the run off happen, it will be at Hayward field at 5:00 p.m.
More updates to come.
