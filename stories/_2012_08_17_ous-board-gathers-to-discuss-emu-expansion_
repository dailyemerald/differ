Although the EMU renovations have been turned down by students multiple times, the Oregon University System board is gathering on Friday, August 17 at 2pm to discuss putting the project back onto the ballot. This meeting will take place over a conference call.
Despite costs going up, which will increase student fees by $51 per student per year, ASUO President Laura Hinman remains excited about the project. In a letter to Chancellor Pernsteiner she cites her “support and enthusiasm for the renovation” as the reason she contacted him.
Hinman then goes on to say that “each year the project construction is delayed it will result in construction escalation costs, estimated at 4% annually, and it will increase the project cost by approximately $5.4 million dollars.”
Hinman’s push to get the OUS Board to approve the EMU renovations will only succeed if the student body passes the proposal during fall term. According to RBI Strategies and Research, a firm specializing in strategic and management consulting, getting 3000 “Yes” votes would be enough to approve the project.
Also according to RBI Strategies and Research the firm has an “overall budget for the campaign [of] $20,000‐$30,000, based on which funding levels the campaign chooses.”
Former ASUO Chief Executive Kerry Snodgrass thinks Hinman’s confidence could be a result of RBI’s involvement.
“I speculate her confidence comes from that, it’s really difficult to get students to vote a certain way in the fall. There’s a lot of organizing required and it’s hard unless you have a lot of time or money but preferably both.”
Snodgrass and Programs Finance Committee member Andrew Lubash plan to read testimony against the renovation during Friday’s call.
