Word came this afternoon that redshirt-freshman wide receiver Tacoi Sumler has decided to transfer to an undetermined school after only one year at Oregon. Sumler came to Eugene as a highly regarded speedster out of Florida and was thought to be among those vying for reps at the “TZR” position – a hybrid of running back and slot receiver – this fall.
The Emerald spoke with Sumler in the spring, and he said that “It’s a big change from Miami to Oregon” in regards to adjusting to college.
