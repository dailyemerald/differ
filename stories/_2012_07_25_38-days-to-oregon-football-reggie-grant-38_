Editor’s note: In the final 50 days before Chip Kelly and the Ducks return to the field to defend their status as Pac-12 Champions, the Emerald sports desk will take a look back at one Oregon alum each day whose jersey number corresponds to the amount of days left before the season opener against Arkansas State.
His name may be largely lost upon all but the most obsessive of Duck fans, but in the mid ’70s Reggie Grant’s skills included returning kicks and stopping opponents drives in their tracks by picking off passes. Grant’s best year was his senior season in 1977 when the defensive back returned kicks and punts, including one for a touchdown, to add to his two interceptions on the season.
Grant was a late-round draft pick in 1978, where he was picked up 225th overall by the New York Jets. Grant was one of two Ducks drafted that year, along with center Fred Quillan, who was picked up in the seventh round by San Francisco. Quillan went on to win two Super Bowls with the 49ers and played in two Pro Bowls over the course of his career.
