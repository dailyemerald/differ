Editor’s note: In the final 50 days before Chip Kelly and the Ducks return to the field to defend their status as Pac-12 Champions, the Emerald sports desk will take a look back at one Oregon alum each day whose jersey number corresponds to the amount of days left before the season opener against Arkansas State.
Justin Phinisee was a standout defensive back and kick returner for the Ducks from 2002 to 2005 known for his big-play ability and adaptability, playing both corner positions and safety during his Oregon career.
After spending his freshman year primarily on special teams, Phinisee started nine games on defense in 2003: Five at right cornerback and four on the left side. His biggest game came on the biggest stage as Oregon upset the Michigan Wolverines – which led to a Sports Illustrated cover spread – in Auzten Stadium. Phinisee recorded both a sack and an interception of Michigan quarterback John Navarre to go along with his team-high eight tackles.
In 2004, Phinisee continued his standout special teams performance, earning All Pac-10 honorable mention for his efforts, which included a touchdown against UCLA – the first of his collegiate career. 2005 brought more success on defense, as the senior led the nation in interception-return yards and closed out his Oregon career with a win in the Civil War’s infamous “Fog Bowl.”
After his career at Oregon, Phinisee had brief stints in the NFL with a number of teams including the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots, before moving on to the Canadian Football League in 2008.
