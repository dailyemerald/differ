We begin today with the world of competitive scrabble (which apparently is a thing) where an unidentified youth player was kicked out of the national championship for hiding extra blank tiles.  Deadspin has more.
In this video feature from Sports Illustrated, Stewart Mandel and Andy Staples break down the most likely candidates to win this year’s Heisman Trophy.  Oregon WR/RB/PR (did we get all that) DeAnthony Thomas is among the notables, along with preseason favorite Matt Barkley and Virginia Tech quarterback Logan Thomas.
Elsewhere in the magazine realm, the Emerald’s own Duck Season magazine hits newsstands Monday, but the digital edition is online now.
The Pac-12 network is set to launch tonight, with a replay of last year’s Pac-12 title game between the Ducks and UCLA slated to be among the early programming.  From the Oregonian, Paul Buker breaks down where to find the Pac-12 network throughout the state.
Finally, the US Men’s soccer team ventures into Estadio Azteca today for a friendly-in-name-only matchup with Mexico.  Soccer blog The Shin Guardian previews the US matchup with El Tri.
