Oregon’s 1994 season was full of intrigue and emotion, starting with a pair of early losses  and finishing with an emotional win over Washington and a conference-clincher in Corvallis against the Oregon State Beavers. Making their first trip to the Rose Bowl since 1958, the Ducks looked to upset undefeated Penn State and star running back Ki-Jana Carter.
The contest didn’t get off to the best of starts for Oregon’s “Gang Green” defense as Carter galloped 83 yards to give the Nittany Lions the first points of the game. Oregon quarterback Danny O’Neil wouldn’t go lightly however, carrying the Ducks on his arm to eventually tie the game at 14 early in the third quarter. O’Neil would set Rose Bowl records for total passing yardage, passes attempted and passes completed over the course of the afternoon.
Carter proved to be too much for Oregon to handle in the end and Penn State’s defense forced key turnovers down the stretch as Joe Paterno took his team back to Happy Valley with a 38-20 victory and a perfect season.
