The Ducks released their week one depth chart Friday, with news that redshirt freshman Marcus Mariota would start at quarterback over sophomore Bryan Bennett. While the conclusion of that position battle will justifiably dominate the news cycle, the two-deep roster reveals the rest of the winners and losers from Oregon’s fall camp.
At kicker, Rob Beard and Alejandro Maldonado will split duties against Arkansas State. Beard is listed as placekicker, while Maldonado will kick off to start the season. Maldonado took over kicking duties from Rob Beard last year and redeemed his missed kick against USC — the one that would have forced overtime, not that anyone likely needs reminding — with a solid outing in the Rose Bowl. But Beard looks ready for a productive senior campaign.
