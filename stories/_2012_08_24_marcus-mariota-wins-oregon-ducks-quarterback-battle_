Aaron Fentress and the Oregonian are reporting that redshirt freshman Marcus Mariota has beaten out sophomore Bryan Bennett to helm Oregon’s high-tempo offense when the Ducks face Arkansas State on September 1.
Mariota, signed in 2011 as a three-star recruit out of Honolulu, Hawaii, sat out the 2011 season but was on the travel squad as the third string quarterback behind Bennett and starter Darron Thomas. A strong spring showing began speculation that he could challenge Bennett for the starting role and he continued his strong showing through fall camp.
Mariota will be the first freshman quarterback to start the opening game for Oregon since Bill Musgrave in 1987.
