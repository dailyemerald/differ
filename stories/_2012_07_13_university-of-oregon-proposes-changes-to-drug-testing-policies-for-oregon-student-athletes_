The University of Oregon released on Friday a list of proposed amendments and additions to its current student-athlete drug policy, including implementing random drug-tests.
The rules “emphasize that illicit and performance enhancing drugs are not allowed, provide for random drug testing, outline sanctions for positive drug tests, outline drug testing methods, and encourage self-reporting and treatment for drug use.”
The release stated the amendments are necessary because “the University seeks to educate its student-athletes about the detrimental effects of drug use on their health, safety, academic work and future careers.”
It also stated that the “University must abide by NCAA rules and uphold the integrity of its Athletic Department” and that “student-athletes represent the University in various settings.” It also emphasized that “the University has an interest in promoting drug-free and healthful lifestyles to all of the community through its athletics programs.”
The amendments and additions will not be enacted until after a public hearing has occurred. The hearing will take place on Aug. 23 at 2 p.m. in the Walnut Room of the EMU.
In order to make these changes a reality, the UO is requesting $35,000 of additional annual funding from the Oregon University System.
In the State of Oregon, however, it is illegal for any public institution — including schools — to perform random drug testing on student-athletes unless they have “reasonable suspicion” to act. Reasonable suspicious usually results from someone — such as teammate, trainer or coach — reporting witnessed drug use or suspicion that it is occurring.
