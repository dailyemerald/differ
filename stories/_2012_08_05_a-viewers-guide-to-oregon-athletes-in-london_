Eugene, as we all likely know, is often referred to as TrackTown USA. But for the next month, many former University of Oregon alumni will be taking their talents outside of the country to compete against the world’s best at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. 
The UO will be sending two former Olympians (Galen Rupp and Andrew Wheating) in addition to eight more athletes making their debuts at the games: Keshia Baker, Zoe Buckman, Matthew Centrowitz, Ashton Eaton, Becky Holliday, Cyrus Hostetler, Brianne Theisen and Rachel Yurkovich.
Here’s a breakdown of how to keep up with the events across the pond this week. Note that many of the races are preceded by qualifying rounds, and the participation of these former UO athletes is dependent upon their advancement in the preliminaries.
