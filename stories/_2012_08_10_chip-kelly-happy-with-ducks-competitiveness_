The Ducks finished their first practice in full pads Friday, their last before two-a-day practices begin tomorrow morning. The Ducks put those pads to good use in a physical practice with a focus on competitive blocking and tackling drills. While the intensity will be ratcheted back somewhat as the Oregon’s September 1 opener approaches, the Ducks aren’t holding much back even in physical situations.
“You don’t want people on the ground,” Kelly said. “But that doesn’t mean we’re not hitting and it’s not physical.”
Oregon begins two-a-day practices tomorrow, but Kelly says it won’t be much of a change for the team.
“These kids are here every morning and they’re either stretching or lifting,” Kelly said. “Now we just have the practice so we don’t have the stretching and lifting.”
