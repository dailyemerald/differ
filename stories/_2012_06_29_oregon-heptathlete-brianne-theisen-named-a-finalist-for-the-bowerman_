Friday afternoon, Oregon heptathlete Brianne Theisen was named one of three female finalists for The Bowerman, the highest honor given to athletes in collegiate track & field. Theisen was already named the USTFCCCA Indoor and Outdoor National Field Athlete of the Year earlier this year. The Bowerman is essentially the Heisman Trophy of collegiate track and field.
Theisen just completed her senior year for the Ducks, winning a third national championship in the heptathlon. Yesterday, the Humboldt, Sask., native made the Canadian Olympic Team. She’s joins her fiance, former Duck Ashton Eaton, as a competitor in the multi-events in London.
