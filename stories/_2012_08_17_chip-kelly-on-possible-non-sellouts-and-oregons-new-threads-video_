Oregon Head Coach Chip Kelly didn’t spend much time talking about on-field happenings after practice Friday, as he fielded questions on Oregon’s new uniforms – scheduled for a full release on August 22nd – and the recent news that the Ducks’ streak of 82 consecutive sellouts at Autzen Stadium is in peril with 5,000 tickets still available for the game against Arkansas State.
“I think it’s a great opportunity,” Kelly said of the ticket situation. “There’s a lot of people I’ve heard, since I’ve been here, about how hard it is to get a ticket to a game. Now there’s 5,000 open, so people who haven’t had a chance to get here…buy ‘em up.”
On his players, Kelly was pleased with his players’ effort on the practice field, saying that he’s seen improvements on the field and that they’re starting to grasp what’s being shown to them. He also deferred to the players when asked about his input on the new uniforms, saying that the players had most of the input there.
