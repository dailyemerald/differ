Well, nobody saw this coming.
The deadline for first year players to sign contracts came and went on Friday, and Oregon’s Aaron Jones went unsigned after being picked up by Colorado in the 18th round.  Rather than return for his junior season, however, the powerhitting outfielder will be leaving the Ducks program to pursue a career as a firefighter, head coach George Horton told the Register Guard last night.
Jones was among the Ducks biggest power threats last season, finishing the season with 39 RBI and 6 home runs, which tied him for the team lead with Kyle Garlick.  His .303 average was one of just three .300 or better hitters in the Ducks regular starting lineup. While Jones retains two years of eligibility, Horton told the Register Guard that Jones new career path is a “done deal.”
