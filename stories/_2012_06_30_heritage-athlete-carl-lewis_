Each day of Trials competition, renowned American athletes are honored in conjunction with the events of the day. Here is Sunday’s honoree:
Frederick Carlton “Carl” Lewis — born July 1, 1961 in Birmingham, Ala. — is one of two track athletes to win nine Olympic gold medals. He competed in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump and 4×100-meter relay in the 1984 Olympic Games, receiving gold medals in each. He continued on to the 1988 Olympics, where he defended his titles in both the 100 meters and long jump.
Lewis again defended his long jump title at the 1992 and 1996 games, while also getting another 4×100-meter relay gold medal in ’92. In 1991, he set the indoor world record for long jump with a distance of 8.79 meters, which still stands today. He recorded 65 consecutive victories in the long jump — one of track’s longest winning streaks.
Lewis was inducted into the USA Track & Field Hall of Fame in 2001 and has been recognized by Sports Illustrated and the International Olympic Committee as Olympian and Sportsman of the Century, respectively.
