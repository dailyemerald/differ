The wait is over.
After a summer of secrecy and speculation, the Ducks revealed their new football uniforms for the 2012 season. Nike employees have kept the design under lock and key, but if former uniforms are any indication, the new set is sure to make national headlines.
The athletic department released the photos on their Facebook page, and the high tech specifications on their website.
From the cleats to the base layer, to the gloves and helmet, the Ducks’ uniform represents the pinnacle in game-day innovation for speed. As launched during the Rose Bowl, the latest development of Nike Chain Maille Mesh technology is the ultimate in breathable uniform design. These innovations coupled with durable, lightweight padding provide athletes with a complete on-field suit of armor.

 
The unis also hit The Duck Store, where fans can see the details in the new shoulder feathers.
