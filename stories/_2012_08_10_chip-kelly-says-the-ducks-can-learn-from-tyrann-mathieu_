Oregon head coach Chip Kelly said Friday that LSU’s decision to remove Tyrann Mathieu from the team after violating team rules is a reminder of how quickly a career can change due to bad decisions. Kelly said the coaching staff urges the team to learn from the mistakes of others — both players from other programs like Mathieu or former Ducks with disciplinary issues such as Cliff Harris — to avoid making the same bad choices themselves.
“It’s unfortunate because the kid was a heck of a football player, but you’ve got to make the right decisions” Kelly said. “Coach Miles feels the same way that all of us do — playing football is a privilege and with that comes responsibilities.”
