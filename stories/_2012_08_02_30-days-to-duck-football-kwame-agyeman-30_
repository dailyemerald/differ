Editor’s note: In the final 50 days before Chip Kelly and the Ducks return to the field to defend their status as Pac-12 Champions, the Emerald sports desk will take a look back at one Oregon alum each day whose jersey number corresponds to the amount of days left before the season opener against Arkansas State.
As defensive back for the Ducks from 2005 to 2007, Kwame Agyeman was on hand for some of the more memorable games in program history as the Ducks upset Oklahoma in 2006 at Autzen Stadium and trounced Michigan in Ann Arbor a year later. Agyeman led the Ducks in tackles in 2006 and was near the top of the list in 2007 as well, finishing behind Jerome Boyd and Nick Reed.
Agyeman took a direct snap 40 yards on a fake punt against Arizona in his senior season before fumbling the ball at the end of the run, turning the fourth down conversion into a turnover. It was in the same game against Arizona in which Dennis Dixon’s knee injury ended his Heisman campaign, sparking the series of events that led the then 8-1 Ducks to lose their next three games, shattering the team’s BCS Bowl aspirations.
Since leaving Oregon, Agyeman has played for the Indoor Football League’s Tri-City Fever.
